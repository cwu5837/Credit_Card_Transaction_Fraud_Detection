# Credit-Card-Transaction-Fraud-Detection
This project is to predict credit card transaction fraud using supervised learning methods

# Intro
Based on the 96,708 credit card transaction record informaion, we conducted data cleaning, created time-window variables, and performed machinea learning methods including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, XGBoost and SVM to predict the abnormal transactions. With XG-Boost algorithm, we achieved FDR of 73.7% at 2% of the population.
